## Overview
### Description
Travel organization app with social integration. Allows users to sign in and add friends to create travel plan. Create itinerary, packing list, and list of places to visit along with potential rooms to stay.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Travel + Social Networking
- **Mobile:** Mobile is essential for easy continuous updates of travel plans and allows multi user interaction. 
- **Story:** Encourages group traveling by allowing all members of the team/group to provide ideas. 
- **Market:** Anyone planning to travel can use the app, ideally 16+. Those in college wanting to go on spring break or in their twenties planning an annual vacation can use the app.
- **Habit:** Only applicable to traveling so habit of usage is proportional to the number of times one travels. The app can encourage small weekend trips as well.
- **Scope:** V1: basic itinerary(list of places and things to do) w/ image upload of destination + log in + share tool to add friends
V2: incorporate google flights/maps api to show location of destination and places to go in destination
V3: Add packing list
V4: List of place users plan to stay hotels/hostels/airbnb api

**Don't know if I want user to just include others users who have access or if I want to do followers?**
